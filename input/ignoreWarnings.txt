# The following SocketTimeoutExceptions appear to be a result of http://tx.fhir.org/r4 issues validating icd-10-cm codes. The "timeout" or "Read timed out" errors have both appeared, which is why both errors are listed here (0 uses explanation). There is a Zulip thread asking for guidance on this issue: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/ICD-10.20SocketTimeoutException.20in.20IG

# The reported slice mismatches involve the extensions artifact-author, rulesText, wg, fmm, and standards-status. These extensions come from the core FHIR R4 extension pack and are meant to appear on generic DomainResource / Resource profiles. They are not intended to follow the crmi-expandedvalueset slicing rules, so the validator’s comparison is not applicable.
